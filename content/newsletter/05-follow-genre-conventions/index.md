Each Tuesday, I will send you a tip from the world of UX Research & Design for games. At my website The Acagamic, I focus on training people to become better researchers and designers for games and beyond.

Each tip will only take a few minutes to read.

> Players hate change. Be aware of the baby duck syndrome when designing your game. Follow genre conventions.

Genres help players anticipate the general mechanics, themes, and gameplay elements of a given game. Just as newly hatched geese imprint on the first creature they encounter, players often develop a strong attachment to the first game of a specific genre they play. This connection, similar to the imprinting theory proposed by Konrad Lorenz, influences their expectations and preferences for future activities. As a result, game designers who wish to provide players with a pleasurable and familiar experience must adhere to genre conventions. In this issue of the newsletter, we will discuss the significance of genre conventions in arcade-style video games.

# Arcade-Style Imprinting: Nostalgia and Expectations

Arcade-style games, characterized by their fast-paced, action-packed gameplay and relatively simple mechanics, have been a popular genre since the early days of gaming. Many players who experienced classic arcade titles such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders, or Galaga, have imprinted on these games, leading to specific expectations when encountering new arcade-style releases. Players expect:

- **Instant action**: Arcade games are known for throwing players into the action right from the start, with little time spent on tutorials or lengthy narratives.
- **Simple controls**: Players often appreciate the simplicity of arcade-style games, with limited buttons or inputs required to execute in-game actions.
- **High-score chasing**: One of the core features of arcade-style games is the pursuit of high scores, providing players with a clear goal and encouraging replayability.

# The Power of Familiarity: Navigating Genre Conventions

When developing an arcade-style game, it is essential to consider these player expectations and follow genre conventions to create a familiar and enjoyable experience. By incorporating well-known mechanics and themes, developers can tap into the nostalgia and comfort that players associate with the genre. This familiarity can prove advantageous for several reasons:

- **Reduced learning curve**: Players who are familiar with a genre's conventions can quickly adapt to the gameplay, reducing the time and effort required to become proficient.
- **Increased enjoyment**: Meeting player expectations can lead to a more satisfying experience, as the game aligns with their preconceived notions of what an arcade-style game should entail.
- **Enhanced replayability**: By incorporating elements such as high-score chasing, developers can encourage players to invest more time in their game, improving its longevity and replay value.

# Balance and Innovation: Evolving Within Genre Constraints

It is essential that developers adhere to genre conventions, but they must also establish a balance between familiarity and innovation. Incorporating new concepts and mechanics can help distinguish a game from others in its genre, while still adhering to the genre's core conventions. This equilibrium can be attained by:

- **Creative twists**: Developers can introduce fresh gameplay mechanics or unique visual styles that set their game apart from other arcade-style titles, without abandoning the genre's core features.
- **Updated technology**: Leveraging modern technology to enhance graphics, audio, or gameplay can provide players with a fresh yet familiar experience, bridging the gap between classic arcade games and contemporary releases.
- **Expanding upon the classics**: Developers can build upon the foundations laid by iconic arcade titles, using them as inspiration while adding their own unique touches to create a new yet familiar experience.

Video game makers need to stick to genre conventions if they want to give players a familiar and fun experience. Producers can make games that connect with their target audience if they know what players expect from a certain genre after their first experience with it. In arcade-style games, this means having fast action, easy controls, and a goal of getting a high score, while also adding new ideas and new technology. Finding the right mix between sticking to genre norms and adding new ideas can lead to a game that not only meets player expectations but also stands out from other games in the same genre.
