This online course trains how user experience (UX) methods are used in a game context. The course consists of three units: UX design for games, games user research, and game analytics. The course material comes from the "Games User Research" book published by Oxford University Press, and the book's editors will teach it. This course focuses on UX design and research for game development. Students will learn the skills they need to recognize, analyze, and understand player feedback so they can make valid decisions about how to design games. Through exercises and assignments, participants will learn how to identify factors that affect how a player plays a game and how to incorporate feedback into their design process. Participants will learn ways to get information from players, such as through direct observation, interviews, and surveys. Participants will be equipped with skills, knowledge, and tools to understand players to create engaging games.

# UX Research on a Budget: Methods, Tips, and Considerations

### Presented by Pejman Mirza-Babaei

## Why Address UX Research on a Budget?
This topic is included in the course because many questions arise from students, academics, and game companies—particularly smaller companies—about conducting UX research on a budget and where compromises can be made. As someone who has consulted with smaller companies that lack extensive research teams, this subject is particularly important to me.

Today, we will discuss the reasons for considering budget-friendly UX research, common issues, and tips for conducting better UX research.

## Common Misconceptions in UX Research
In my experience working with game companies, there are several misconceptions about what constitutes UX research or usability testing. Here are some common ways game companies refer to playtesting or testing in general:

1. **Internal dev testing:** Developers play their game to evaluate the progress of implemented features. This type of playtesting can be helpful, but it doesn't always align with academic definitions of UX research or usability testing.

2. **Expo demos:** Studios showcase their games at expos or events, where players give feedback on their experiences. While this involves playtesting, it focuses more on marketing and appreciation analysis than actual UX research.

3. **QA testing:** Quality assurance personnel or consultants test games to find bugs and offer usability suggestions. This is another way some companies refer to testing, but it is not the same as academic UX research.

4. **A/B testing:** Companies compare two different versions of a feature to determine which one is better. This method can be useful, but it is not the same as UX research or usability testing.

5. **Ideation testing:** Participants engage with the product, but the company is not looking for specific feedback. Instead, they are seeking ideas for the design or development team to consider.

6. **Usability and appreciation testing:** This is what most academics consider UX research, focusing on the user experience and satisfaction with the product.


## Balancing Resources and Data Collection
While all these methods can help improve a game, the question is whether they can be combined to save resources. For example, if a small company is marketing their game at an expo, can they also collect data to help improve the game?

The key question to consider is how to differentiate between good, reliable, valid data and bad, misleading data. In my experience, many companies make mistakes in this area, drawing inaccurate conclusions from demos or internal dev testing.

As UX research experts, it is essential to help companies understand the reliability of their data and make informed decisions.

## Discussion Points
Over to you, think about these questions:

- How can we effectively conduct UX research on a budget?
- What are the best practices for combining different testing methods?
- How can we help companies differentiate between reliable and unreliable data?
- Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences as we dive into this important topic.
